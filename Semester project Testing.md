## Introduction

We have chosen to combine the project from the database course and the testing course respectively. We think the assignment in the database course provides a solid foundation for which we can perform the practices from the testing course. 

### Testing

In our application we will cover the following subjects:

- Static testing techniques
- Test case design
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- UI Testing
- Front-end testing
- Mocking
- Tool-based system testing
- Continuous integration
- Behavior driven development
- Test driven development
- Testing analytics

## Learning objectives

#### Get an understanding of working with the four agile testing quadrants

To fulfill the first quadrant we will ensure that our application is properly covered by unit tests. To fulfill the second quadrant we will perform behavior driven development in conjunction with test-driven development. To fulfill the third quadrant we will ensure that our UI is properly tested across the most popular user-agents, as well as performing exploratory testing. To fulfill the last quadrant we will test the performance and load of our application as well as ensuring that the application is secure by writing security tests.

The above text can be boiled down to the following:

**First quadrant:**

- Write unit tests

**Second quadrant:**

- Perform TDD / BDD

**Third quadrant:** 

- Write UI Tests
- Perform exploratory testing

**Fourth quadrant:**

- Perform performance & load testing
- Test security



#### Get an understanding of working with continuous integration

We want to get experience with, and a better understanding of working with continuous integration. By implementing a continuous integration workflow, we will ensure that our application is thoroughly tested before any code is released.
