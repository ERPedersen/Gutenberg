The project consists of a Mongo database, a MySQL database, a back-end and a front-end. 


#### Back-end
The backend is a three-layer application written in Java 8, which exposes a REST API, that allows interaction with both the MongoDB and SQL database. The back-end uses JUnit4 for unit testing combined with the frameworks Mockito for mocking/stubbing and Hamcrest for matching.

#### Front-end
The front-end is a web-application created with Typescript, HTML and SCSS in Angular 4. The front-end uses Karma to run Jasmine unit-tests in the PhantomJS browser. It also uses protractor to perform e2e tests on the entire system.

We have used CI with the project [Travis-CI.com](https://travis-ci.org/ERPedersen/Gutenberg) .
